# Welcome to My GitHub Garage   

This is my little corner of the internet where I keep things I make and donâ€™t want to throw away. Some projects are useful, some are just experiments, but all of them represent a part of my journey in coding, tech, and creativity.  

## About Me  

ðŸ”¹ Passionate about technology and problem-solving.  
ðŸ”¹ Love riding my bike and exploring new places.  
ðŸ”¹ My flow when using my keyboard and Vim motions feels just like when I ride my bikeâ€”pure flow state.
